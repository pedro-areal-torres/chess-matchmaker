# ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Matchmaker - Tournament Scheduler

**Chess Matchmaker** generates **tournament schedules** using different formats:

- **Round Robin** (Everyone plays against everyone)
- **Rating-Based Groups** (Players are grouped based on their rating and play Round Robin)

This package **automatically handles an odd number of players** by adding a **BYE** when necessary.
